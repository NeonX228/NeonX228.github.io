        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>I build games that challenge, immerse, and sometimes confuse players (in a fun way, I promise). Specializing in gameplay programming and technical design, I turn ideas into interactive experiences. My toolkit includes Unity (C#), Godot (GDScript), Python, and Lua—because one engine is never enough.</p>

                <h3>Time-Travelling Droplet</h3>
                <p>A 2D side-scrolling platformer where time travel isn’t just a gimmick—it’s survival.
                    Switch between two world states to dodge obstacles and reach the finish line. Perfect timing is the key (and maybe a little bit of luck).</p>

                <h3>Self-Sabotage</h3>
                <p>A 3D murder-mystery puzzle solving game. Made in SPX style. Each day feels normal—until you take out the trash. Locked doors, missing keys, and unsettling whispers hint at a truth your mind refuses to accept. Someone is working against you… but is it yourself?</p>

        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <p>I love making puzzle games, simulators, and tycoon games, crafting mechanics that make players think, strategize, and maybe rage-quit (but in a good way). My focus? Immersion, replayability, and technical innovation. I also have a mild obsession with optimizing scripts—because smooth gameplay is non-negotiable.</p>
